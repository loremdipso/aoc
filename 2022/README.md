Advent of Code - 2022

https://adventofcode.com/2022/

Let's this year get fancy. Let's try out a python package to fetch the
data via an API: https://github.com/wimglenn/advent-of-code-data

```
pip install advent-of-code-data
```

Then you need to set AOC_SESSION in a .env file:

```
export AOC_SESSION=xxx
```
